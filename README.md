Hello! This is my personal website with project descriptions, contact info, and general "about me" things!

My name is Morgan Rae Reschenberg and I'm a senior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and STEM Education. After graduation, I'll be working in San Francisco as an accessibility engineer at Mozilla :)
