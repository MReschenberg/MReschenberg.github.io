Hello! This is my personal website with project descriptions, contact info, and general "about me" things!

My name is Morgan Rae Reschenberg and I'm an Accessibility Platform Engineer at Mozilla :) Before starting here, I was an Instructor and (before that) student at UC Berkeley in the Computer Science department.
