Hello! This is my personal website with project descriptions, contact info, and general "about me" things!

My name is Morgan Rae Reschenberg and I'm a senior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and STEM Education. I'm looking for full-time engineering roles starting Summer 2019 in the San Francisco Bay Area. Thanks for checking out my website!
